# Gradient descent implementation on a bike-share prediction problem.

## Introduction

Implemented gradient descent using numpy in the my_answer.py file.It is then imported into the notebook to be implemented on the bike sharing application.

## Hyper parameters set

iterations = 15000
learning rate = 0.1
hidden nodes = 6
output nodes = 1
